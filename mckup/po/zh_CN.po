msgstr ""

#: data/content/about.html:20
msgid "Using the ISO file provided for the spin you're interested in, you can create a CD or DVD that will boot into the spin when you insert it into a computer and turn it on or reboot. Alternatively, using that same ISO file, you can also create a bootable USB stick which will also boot into the spin when you insert it into a computer and turn it on or reboot."
msgstr ""

#: data/content/about.html:21
msgid "One thing to remember when you run a spin off of a CD or DVD is that as you use the system, any additional applications you install will not be there when you reboot your computer - there isn't any way to work around this because you cannot write out to bootable CD or DVD media. Additionally, any files you save will be lost when you reboot because Fedora runs off of the media, it doesn't access your hard drive.. When using CD or DVD bootable spins, you should always make sure you save your files to an external device such as a USB key or USB hard drive. (<a href=\"http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD\">Learn more about creating and using bootable CD or DVD media for spins here</a>.)"
msgstr ""

#: data/content/about.html:22
msgid "When you use a USB stick to boot your spin, you have an extra option to save some of the disk space on the USB stick as permanent storage. If you choose to create the media for your spin this way, then any applications you've install on your running spin, and any files you save to disk will still be present when you reboot your computer, as long as you don't go over the amount of available free space on your USB stick.

The <a href=\"/games/\">Fedora Games Spin</a> and the <a href=\"/fel/\">Fedora Electronic Lab</a> are good examples of this kind of spin. There are a lot of packages in Fedora, and it can be time-consuming to look up and install all the software you might need for a particular task. The creators of these kind of spins have done all this legwork for you already, so if you run one of these spins, the software you need will already be installed."

For example, if you'd like to try out a new desktop environment, you can run the appropriate spin's live media and see if you like it without risk to your current computer's setup. You can also use spins on a friend's computer to show them how cool Fedora is without them needing to do a full install or lose their files! (And later, when you've convinced them to do a full install, they can use the spin media to install straight to their hard drive. :) )"
