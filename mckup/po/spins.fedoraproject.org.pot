"Using the ISO file provided for the spin you're interested in, you can "

"One thing to remember when you run a spin off of a CD or DVD is that as "
"you use the system, any additional applications you install will not be "
"there when you reboot your computer - there isn't any way to work around "
"this because you cannot write out to bootable CD or DVD media. "
"Additionally, any files you save will be lost when you reboot because "
"Fedora runs off of the media, it doesn't access your hard drive.. When "
"using CD or DVD bootable spins, you should always make sure you save your"
