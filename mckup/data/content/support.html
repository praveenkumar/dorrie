    <p>${_('BitTorrent is a way to download information in cooperation with other computers. Each computer cooperating in the group downloads pieces of the information in a particular torrent from other peers in the group. Computers that have finished downloading all the data in a torrent remain in the swarm to seed, or provide data to other peers. If you download using BitTorrent, as a courtesy you should seed the torrent at least until you have uploaded the same amount of data you downloaded.')}</p>
	<p>${_('If your computer does not have software installed for BitTorrent, visit the BitTorrent home page at &lt;a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/download/"&gt;http://www.bittorrent.com/download/&lt;/a&gt; to download it. BitTorrent client software is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and many other operating systems.')}</p>

In the case of the Fedora spins, the torrent files tell BitTorrent where it should connect in order to download the ISO file for a Fedora spin.')}</p>
